# C++/Qt plugins

Native plugins are basically shared libraries.
Their distribution is not that trivial due to ABI compatibilitiy (system libraries, compiler(-flags), system architecture, Qt versions, etcâ€¦).
Therefore developing native plugins is rather worth it if you plan to get your code upstream and finally be shipped with the official plugins.
For personal workflows or less complex use cases Python plugins are the way to go.

## Getting started

The easiest way to build plugins is to checkout the source tree and build the entire app including plugins.
Open the CMake project in your favourite C++ IDE and make it build and run.
There may be some caveats, so probably you want to join the chats and ask in case of questions.
From there on you could simply copy an existing plugin, e.g. the template plugin, and start implementing your extension. 
The following gives a brief overview.
Details may change every now and then anyway. 

## CMake

A native plugin is a [Qt Plugin](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/plugins-howto.html#the-low-level-api-extending-qt-applications), i.e. a shared library providing a particular interface.
To build such a library you have to define CMake targets and create an appropiate metadata file.
The `albert_plugin` macro defined in the [CMake module]([url](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albertlauncher/albert/master/cmake/albert-macros.cmake)) takes care of this for you. You should probably skim through this module once to understand what it actually does. These are the parameters it takes:

|         Parameter |  Type  | Notes                                                                                  |
|------------------:|:------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|              NAME | value  | **MANDATORY** Human readable name                                                      |
|       DESCRIPTION | value  | **MANDATORY** Brief, imperative description                                            |
|  LONG_DESCRIPTION | value  | *Optional* Longer description or absolute file path to text file (supports Markdown).  |
|           LICENSE | value  | **MANDATORY** Short form e.g. BSD-2-Clause or GPL-3.0                                  |
|               URL | value  | **MANDATORY** Browsable source, issues etc                                             |
|          FRONTEND | option | *Optional* Indicates that this plugin implements the frontend interface                |
|       MAINTAINERS |  list  | *Optional* Active maintainers. Preferrably using mentionable GitHub usernames          |
|   QT_DEPENDENCIES |  list  | *Optional* Qt::Core is exported from albert, auto import and link                      |
|  LIB_DEPENDENCIES |  list  | *Optional* Required libraries                                                          |
| EXEC_DEPENDENCIES |  list  | *Optional* Required executables                                                        |

A CMakeLists.txt of a regular plugin could look like this:

```cmake
project(plugin_identifier VERSION 1.0)
albert_plugin(
    NAME "Plugin pretty name"
    DESCRIPTION "Brief description"
    LICENSE GPL
    URL https://mydomain.com/myurl
    MAINTAINERS @yourname
)
```

## C++

On the C++ side you have to tell the MOC which interface the plugin implements and where the metadata is located.
This is done by the `ALBERT_PLUGIN` define. The MOC is triggered by the QOBJECT define.
The fundamental base class for _all_ plugins is `albert::PluginInstance`.
It is subclassed by the convenience classes for native plugins in the [`albert::plugin`](https://albertlauncher.github.io/reference/namespacealbert_1_1plugin.html) namespace.
Read their documentation before you proceed.
Check the inheritance diagram of the [`albert::Extension`](https://albertlauncher.github.io/reference/classalbert_1_1Extension.html) class for available extensions, especially the `albert::TriggerQueryHandler` and its subclasses.
By now you should understand a plugin class declaration like this: 

```cpp
#pragma once
#include "albert/extension/queryhandler/triggerqueryhandler.h"
#include "albert/plugin.h"

class Plugin : public albert::plugin::ExtensionPlugin<albert::TriggerQueryHandler>
{
    Q_OBJECT ALBERT_PLUGIN
    ...
};
```

Now implement the virtual functions of the abstract classes you inherit.
Ultimately you want to display and activate items.
See 
 * the [`albert::Action`](https://albertlauncher.github.io/reference/classalbert_1_1Action.html),
 * the abstract [`albert::Item`](https://albertlauncher.github.io/reference/classalbert_1_1Item.html) and
 * the [`albert::StandardItem`](https://albertlauncher.github.io/reference/structalbert_1_1StandardItem.html) class.

Self explanatory examples serve way better as educational source than hundreds of lines of text.
See the [official native plugins](https://github.com/albertlauncher/plugins/tree/master/) as a reference.
The `debug`, `template` and `hash` plugins are good plugins to start reading. 

Finally you may want to skim through the entire [albert namespace](https://albertlauncher.github.io/reference/namespacealbert.html).
